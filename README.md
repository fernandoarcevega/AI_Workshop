# `AI_Workshop`
Welcome to this workshop on artificial intelligence! In the following days, we will explore both basic and advanced techniques in machine learning, artificial neural networks, and deep neural networks. We will cover the theory behind these methods and provide hands-on practice using the Python programming language.

## `About the instructors`
*   `Dr. Wilfrido Gomez-Flores` obtained a BS in Electronics and Communications Engineering from the Technological University of Mexico in 2004. He then earned an M.Sc. (2006) and D.Sc. (2009) in Electrical Engineering from Cinvestav. Since 2010, he has been a researcher at Cinvestav Tamaulipas Campus. Over the course of his career, he has produced over 100 publications, graduated 14 master's students and four doctoral students, and is a Level 2 in the SNII. His research interests include digital image analysis, pattern recognition, and machine learning.
